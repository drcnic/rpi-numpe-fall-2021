As an interpreted computer language Python needs to reserve certain keywords so it doesn't get confused while interpreting what you write line by line.  These 33 reserved words are:\n",
    " - False, None, True (note the upper case first character in these three),\n",

Most other compiled languages have between dozens and hundreds of reserved words.  Again, some computer scientists counter that a good IDE color-codes reserved words so you know to not use them as variable or function names.
