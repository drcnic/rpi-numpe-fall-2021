However, when the entity being copied is a compound object (e.g., a list of lists), a shallow copy works as intended for the primary object but the sub-objects (e.g., the lists inside the primary list) will behave as an assignment-by-reference.  To get a true physical copy of a compound object you need to use the copy.deepcopy() function from the copy library in Python.  If in your future you need to know the difference then either read the manual, learn Data Structures, or hire someone who has done both.

    "An important takeaway here is that in programming there are often many ways to do the same thing.  Some may be better, some worse, and language wars have been fought time and again over such differences of fact, opinion, and myth.  It is our strong recommendation for those of you still relatively new to programming to not care a whit about making \"Pythonic\" code.  You are engineers, trying to get work done &ndash; first learn how to get your work done. If, in the future, you have a problem so daunting that it requires optimizing the speed of your code, or a project so complex and enduring that it requires highly maintainable code, you'll know it, and you'll learn what you need to know when you need it.  But for now just try anything, and learn by doing.\n",

Some are simpler than this, others seem even more impenetrable in their twisted logic.  Programming is problem solving using algorithms, but like all problem solving it is an art and a science, with many paths to the same goal.  Some easier, and some fraught with danger.  Experience is the best guide to help you know the difference, so be sure to not just review what you learn here, but practice it.  Challenge yourself to understand how other programs work, and experiment by writing your own variations."
